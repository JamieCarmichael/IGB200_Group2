    today, why don\u2019t you start by grabbing my notebook over there for me real
    quick, it\u2019s got some important things written on it. It should just be over
    in the office to the right."

    on track with finishing this place! Everything is in the notebook, I\u2019d do
    it myself but I have other things to handle here. Good luck!"
