  startTaskDialogue:
  - Anyways, now that's done, the site is a bit of a mess today. All of the Carpenter's
    Materials need to get where it's needed, the Electrician is missing his toolbox,
    and apparently the Apprentice made a huge mess over in the car park.
  - Can you go and check on all of them, and help get the site back on track?
  duringTaskDialogue:
  - Go get em Elle! Remember, you can open the Notebook with E to check who you still
    need to help and see a map of the site.
  completeTaskDialogue:
  - Good work Elle! Thanks to you, the site is back on track. We couldn't have done
    it without you.
