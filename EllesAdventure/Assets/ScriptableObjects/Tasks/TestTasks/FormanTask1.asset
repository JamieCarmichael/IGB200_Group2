  startTaskDialogue:
  - Hey Elle, Great to see you on site! Before you get started, can you grab that
    notepad for me? It's over there on that pile of [thing]. You might need to make
    some scaffolding to get up there.
  - 'Remember that you need two wood bundles and one nail pile to make scaffolding.
    Just take it over to the area where the scaffolding will go and press E to build
    it. There should be enough materials in this depot here. '
  duringTaskDialogue:
  - Have you got the Notebook? It's over on the pile of [Thing]. Remember to build
    some scaffolding by taking two wood bundles and one nail pile over to the scaffolding
    area.
  completeTaskDialogue:
  - Great! Now use E to open the notebook. You can use it to track the various odd
    jobs you're doing for people, view the site map, and check profiles for all the
    various workers around the site.
