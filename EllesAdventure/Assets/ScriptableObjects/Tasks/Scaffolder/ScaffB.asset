  startTaskDialogue:
  - There's another toolbox in the big building over there! It's on the upper floor,
    on top of the small room. You'll need to build a few scaffolds to grab that one.
  - You'll need to find the resources yourself for that toolbox. There should be
    a scaffold resource depot next to the first site, but on the upper floor it may
    be messier - You'll need to find them yourself.
  duringTaskDialogue:
  - Go grab the second toolbox! It's on the building to the right.
  completeTaskDialogue:
  - 'Great! Thanks for your help. Hopefully, that scaffolding will help you out.
    Remember to stay safe out there! '
