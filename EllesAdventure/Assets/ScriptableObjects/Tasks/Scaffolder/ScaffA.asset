  startTaskDialogue:
  - "Hey Elle, can you fetch that toolbox prototype up there? It's on the big cube
    behind me. But you'll need scaffolding to get up there! I know you think you\u2019re
    a rebel but Safe Work is a thing you know."
  - 'You can build scaffolding by retrieving all the needed materials as seen on
    the sign for that build. Then build it by pressing E. It''s much safer than trying
    to jump around! '
  - "The scaffolding behind me should already have all the materials you need so
    go give it a build. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep my eye on you. "
  duringTaskDialogue:
  - Just walk up to the scaffolding and press E to assemble it!
  completeTaskDialogue:
  - Thanks Elle! You did great. Just one more thing now!
