  startTaskDialogue:
  - 'Hey Elle, can you fetch the thingy? It''s on the big cube to my right. You''ll
    need scaffolding to get up there!

'
  - You can build scaffolding by retrieving all the needed materials and then pressing
    E. It's much safer! The scaffolding next to the big cube should already have
    all the materials you need.
